/**
 * buildAndSlugPairsToDeployBundles :: Array (Tuple Codeship.Build.Build Heroku.Slug.Slug) -> TaskEither String (Array Deploy.Bundle.Bundle)
 *
 * Converts the given array of Codeship build / Heroku slug pairs into an array of deploy bundles,
 * wrapped in a TaskEither because there are some async operations that need to happen.
 *
 * First, we iterate over all of the pairs, attempting to create a deploy bundle for each.
 * At this point, we will have an array of TaskEithers. We want to end up with a single TaskEither
 * that contains an array, basically we want to invert the structure to make it easier to work with:
 *
 *   Have: Array (TaskEither e a)
 *   Want: TaskEither e (Array a)
 *
 * Usually, we would use array.sequence(taskEither) to accomplish this; that is almost identical to
 * Promise.all. Similar to Promise.all, array.sequence(taskEither) will ignore the result of *all*
 * of the TaskEithers if any one of them is a Left.
 *
 * Unfortunately for us, this isn't the behavior we want! If the attempt to create a deploy bundle
 * for any one build/slug pair fails, that's okay. We want to filter those failures out and keep
 * the successful ones around, not lose everything.
 *
 * We model this by using array.sequence(task) which does the following:
 *
 *  array.sequence(task) :: Array (Task (Either e a))
 *                       -> Task (Array (Either e a))
 *
 * Now, we are still able to work with a single Task, which is __much__ nicer, without losing all
 * of the successful deploy bundles. With Array.rights we can remove all of the failed deploy
 * bundle creations and get an array of the values of the successful ones:
 *
 *   Task.map(Array.rights) :: Task (Array (Either e Bundle))
 *                          -> Task (Array Bundle)
 *
 * We do still, however, really want to end up with that TaskEither (even though we know this
 * function can never fail) becuase it will make it easier to work with in our main function.
 *
 * For that, we can wrap the entire array in one big Either:
 *
 *   Task.map(Either.right) :: Task (Array Bundle)
 *                          -> Task (Either e (Array Bundle))
 *
 * To be clear, `TaskEither e a` is the exact same thing as `Task (Either e a)`, I broke it out
 * with the parenthesis to make the explaination more clear.
